# What is this?

This repository contains the code created while following along with the [Object Oriented PHP & MVC course](https://www.udemy.com/course/object-oriented-php-mvc/) by [Traversy Media](https://www.traversymedia.com/).

# Why do this course?

Creating your own framework is a great way (in my opinion) to understand the inner workings of frameworks and to become familiar with PHP. 

It also opens you up to the possibilities of _not_ using a framework when working on a project.

# Other Resources

I'm a big fan of the [No Framework Tutorial](https://github.com/PatrickLouys/no-framework-tutorial) by [Patrick Louys](https://github.com/PatrickLouys).
